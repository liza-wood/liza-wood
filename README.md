I am a postdoctoral research fellow with the Sustainable Futures Group at University of Exeter, Penryn Campus. I recently earned my PhD from University of California Davis with the Center for Environmental Policy. I’m interested in innovation policy and learning/applying/teaching computational tools to support quantitative social science research.
